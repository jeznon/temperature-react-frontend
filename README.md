this is a project I've created just for test purposes using DHT11 sensor and ESP12f (8266) for reading temperature and humidity, and this frontend is for create some widgets that I've also exposed on my OBS and on my streaming videos, you could use it if you want for learning purposes, also comments are welcome

in order to use it you just need to do an npm install, after that you could start project using webpack serve or npx webpack serve if you dont have webpack-cli installed

use http://localhost/temperature to use temperature widget

use http://localhost/humidity to use humidity widget

use http://localhost/graphtemperature to use graphics temperature widget

use http://localhost/graphhumidity to use graphics humidity widget
